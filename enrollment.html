<p dir="ltr"><strong>1. Applicability</strong><br />This Agreement and Initial Disclosures (the "Agreement") governs your use of the Service. By subscribing to the Service or using the Service, you agree to the terms of this Agreement. Please read this Agreement carefully and in its entirety. We suggest that you retain a copy of this Agreement. We also suggest that you retain a copy of the Software License Agreements included with the Financial Software.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>2. The Service</strong><br />You may use a personal computer ("PC") to electronically direct us to make payments from your Account(s) to Payees whom you have selected in advance to receive payments. You may also access Account and transaction information and order transfers of funds among your eligible Account(s). Not all First Century, Inc. accounts are eligible for electronic transfers and bill payments using the Service.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>3. Software and Equipment Requirements</strong><br />You may access the Service using First Century, Inc. FirstNET and/or the Financial Software. If you choose to use QuickBooks, Quicken, or Microsoft Money, you must purchase this software from Intuit or Microsoft, or a retailer of your choice. Your use of the PC versions of the Financial Software is governed by the Software License Agreements included with the software. You must agree to the terms and conditions of the Software License Agreements during the installation of the Financial Software on your PC. You are responsible for the correct set-up and installation of the Financial Software.<br /><br /><strong>The financial software contains trade secrets in its human perceivable form and, to protect them, you may not modify, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise reduce the financial software to human perceivable form. You may not create derivative works based on the financial software or remove any proprietary notices, labels, or marks on the software or accompanying documentation.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>4. Your User ID and Password</strong><br />You will be asked to choose your personal User ID consisting of 8 - 15 alpha-numeric characters, and a Password consisting of 6 - 12 characters which include at least 2 alpha, 1 numeric and 1 special character, which you will use to obtain access to your Account(s) at First Century, Inc. Password must contain at least two alpha characters. You authorize us to follow any instructions entered through the Service using your User ID and Password. Because your User ID and Password can be used to access money in your Account(s) and to access information about these Account(s), you should treat your User ID and Password with the same degree of care and secrecy that you use to protect your ATM Security code and other sensitive financial data. We may ask you to change your User ID and Password from time to time for security reasons. You agree not to use any language that is abusive, harassing, libelous, defamatory, obscene, or threatening when defining your User ID or any other personalization of your Account(s).</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>5. Sharing Your User ID and Password with Others</strong><br />You agree not to give or make available your User ID, Password, or account number(s) to any person who is not authorized to access your Account(s). If someone to whom you have granted authority to use your User ID and Password exceeds such authority, you are fully liable for all transfers and payments made by such person until you have notified us that you have terminated the authority granted to such person and have given us a reasonable period of time to act upon such notice. We may require that you put such notice in writing. Upon receipt of such notice, we may require you to immediately change your User ID and Password, and to identify the person or persons you believe to have exceeded such authority. You agree to cooperate with us in the investigation and prosecution of any person who has obtained and used your User ID and Password without your authorization.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>6. Bill Payments</strong><br />You may make payments through the Service to any business, merchant, or professional with a valid address that generates a bill or invoice for services, or services provided on your behalf. We reserve the right to refuse to allow you to designate any particular Payee or class of Payee. You may also make payments through the Service to individuals, family, or friends for non-business purposes. Payments may be made only to Payees with a U.S. payment address. You may not make a payment of alimony, child support, taxes, or other governmental fees or court-ordered payments through the Service. Any user of this Service shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations including the laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>7. Your Payee List</strong><br />You must provide sufficient information about each Payee as we may request from time to time, to properly direct a payment to that Payee and permit the Payee to identify the correct Payee Account to credit with your payment. This information may include, among other criteria, the name, address, and phone number of the Payee and your Payee Account number. You agree that we may obtain information regarding your Payee Accounts in order to facilitate proper handling and crediting of your payments, and you authorize your Payees to release such information to us. You can enter your Payee Information directly on your PC. For First Century, Inc. FirstNet, the change will be immediate upon confirmation of the change. Refer to Online Help for additional information about retrieving your account data.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>8. Scheduling Bill Payments</strong><br />To electronically schedule a payment with your PC, follow the simple instructions in the Online Help file or the Financial Software Online Help File. When you schedule a bill payment, you authorize us to withdraw the amount of your payment from your Account(s). If the account balance permits, then the selected checking account will be debited for the amount of the payment(s) that you scheduled. Payments begin processing four (4) business days prior to your schedule payment date. Therefore, the application will not permit you the customer to select a Scheduled Payment Date less than four (4) business days from the current date. When scheduling payments you the customer must select a scheduled payment date that is not later than the actual due date reflected on your payee statement / bill unless that due date falls on a non-business day. If the actual due date falls on a non-business day, you the customer must select a scheduled payment date is at least one (1) business day before the actual due date. Scheduled payments dates should be prior to any late date or grace period.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>9. How Bill Payments are Delivered</strong><br />We may remit your payments by mailing your Payee a paper check, by electronic funds transfer, or by other means. Payees who have a relationship established to receive electronic delivery of payments by us will receive your payment information by a computer link. Electronic payments are generally received and credited by most Payees within two (2) Business Days after the Withdrawal Date. We may also send payments by a paper check drawn on an account we maintain for this purpose. We send all checks through the United States mail. Payments made with a paper draft are generally received and credited by most Payees within five (5) Business Days after the Withdrawal Date. We are not responsible for postal delays or processing delays by the Payees. Occasionally, a Payee chooses not to participate in the Service, or may be unable to process payments in a timely manner. In such cases, we may decline to make future payments to these Payees.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>10. Future Bill Payments</strong><br />You may schedule a payment for a future Business Day up to one year in advance.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>11. Repeating Bill Payments</strong><br />You may schedule payments for a <strong>fixed</strong> amount on the same date every month (a "Repeating Payment"). If the specified Delivery Date does not exist in a certain month, the Delivery Date will be the last Business Day of the month. For example, if the specified Delivery Date is for the 30th of each month, the Delivery Date for the month of February will be on or before the 28th of February. If the specified Withdrawal Date falls on a day other than a Business Day in any month, your Withdrawal Date will be the previous Business Day. For example, if the specified Withdrawal Date is the fifth (5th) of each month, and August 5th is a Saturday, the Withdrawal Date for August will be on or before August 4th.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>12. Guarantee for Bill Payments</strong><br />First Century, Inc. will reimburse you for any late payment fees or penalties you are charged, up to a maximum of $50.00 per scheduled payment, as a result of our failure to deliver a payment made to a business by the Delivery Date if you meet each of the following conditions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" dir="ltr">
<li>You must properly schedule the Withdrawal Date to be on or before the date the payment is due to the Payee, including any required processing time. This means that you must schedule your payments at least four (4) Business Days prior to the date the payment is due to the Payee.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You must provide us with the correct Payee name, address, due date, account information, and the correct payment amount.</li>
<li>Your Account(s), including any overdraft plan, must contain sufficient funds to complete the payment or transfer on the Transaction Date.</li>
<li>The payment must be made to a business.</li>
<li>The late payment fee or penalty, or the method of calculation, must be published by the Payee prior to the date the payment is due to the Payee.</li>
<li>Your PC hardware, software, telephone line, and Internet Service Provider, if applicable, must be functioning properly.</li>
<li>You must provide us with a copy of the statement identifying the late fee.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>13. Stopping or Modifying Bill Payments</strong><br />You may use your PC to electronically change both the payment amount and the Withdrawal Date of any schedule payment (including recurring payments) by following the directions within the application. You can stop any payment before it has been transmitted to the payee, by contacting First Century, Inc. OnLine Support at <strong>+1 (775) 309-4482.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>14. Liability for Failure to Stop Payment (Applicable for Consumers Only)</strong><br />If you order us to stop one of these Repeating Payments three (3) Business Days or more before the Withdrawal Date, and we do not do so, we will be liable for the amount of the payment.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>15. Reviewing Payments and Payment Information</strong><br />For customers using the Financial Software, Payment Information and records of past and future scheduled payments are stored on your PC. The number of records that can be stored depends on the amount of your PC's memory. For First Century, Inc. FirstNet users, Payment Information and records of past and future scheduled payments are stored on the First Century, Inc. computer. Refer to Online Help for additional information about retrieving your payment history.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>16. Incomplete Payments</strong><br />If we remit your payment to a Payee by mailing your Payee a check, and the check has not been presented for payment within our payment cut-off period, we will investigate the status of the check. If the check has not been presented for payment by sixty (60) days after the Withdrawal Date, we will place a stop payment order on the check and credit your account accordingly.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>17. Balance Inquiries</strong><br />You may use the Service to check the balance of your Accounts. The balances shown may differ from your records because they may not include deposits that are not available for withdrawal, outstanding checks, or other withdrawals, payments, or charges.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>18. Cut-off Time for Transfers</strong><br />Transfers between Account(s) initiated via the Service, and received by First Century, Inc. by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time Monday through Friday will be effective on the current Business Day. Transfers between Account(s) initiated via the Service, and received after 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time Monday through Friday, or all day Saturday, Sunday, and banking holidays will be effective the following Business Day.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>19. Future Transfers</strong><br />Transfers scheduled for a future date will be effective at 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time on the requested date of transfer.&nbsp; For example, a transfer scheduled to occur on September 3, will be effective at 12:00 a.m. on September 3.&nbsp; The transfer will be viewable via the Service in available balance on the date of the scheduled transfer.&nbsp; The transfer will be viewable via the Service in transaction history the day following the transfer.&nbsp; Transfer amounts may be any amount up to $100,000.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>20. Stopping or Modifying a Scheduled Transfer</strong><br />A scheduled transfer may be stopped or modified at any time the day prior to the scheduled transfer date.&nbsp; For example, a transfer scheduled for September 3 may be modified or stopped at any time prior to 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time on September 3.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>21. Documentation</strong><br />All of your payments and transfers made through the Service will appear on your periodic account statement. The Payee Name, payment amount, and Withdrawal Date will be reflected for each payment made through the Service.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>22. Fees</strong><br />Monthly fees may be changed with advance notice. Monthly fees for your use of the Service are in addition to any fees that you may incur on your Accounts. There may be additional fees charged against your Accounts if a transaction you initiate using the Service causes any of your Accounts to be overdrawn, exceed the maximum permissible number of transactions for the Accounts, or exceed any other qualifiers for the Accounts. Refer to the Bank Services Agreement and the associated Fee Schedule, as amended from time to time, for these fees. There may also be a charge for upgrades to the Financial Software. You will be notified in advance of any fee payable for software upgrades.<br /><br />You authorize First Century, Inc. to deduct all applicable subscription, service, and use fees for the Service from your Service Charge Account. If we are unable to deduct all applicable fees from your Service Charge Account for any reason (such as, the Account has been closed or there are insufficient funds in the Account), you authorize First Century, Inc. to deduct all applicable fees for the Service from any of your other Accounts. You may designate a different Account for service charge deductions, by notifying a local branch, calling First Century, Inc. OnLine Support at <strong>+1 (775) 309-4482.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>23. Termination</strong><br />You may terminate your use of the Service at any time by visiting your local First Century, Inc. branch office, by calling First Century OnLine Support at <strong>+1 (775) 309-4482</strong>, or by writing to us at First Century, Inc. c/o Electronic Banking Coordinator, P.O. Box 1559, Bluefield, West Virginia 24701. You must notify us at least ten (10) days prior to the date on which you wish to have your Service terminated. We may require that you put your request in writing.
